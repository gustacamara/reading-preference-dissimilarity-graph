Construction of high-density graphs using the knowledge acquired during the classes

# Construction of High-Density Graphs
**Requirements:**
- [x] Export a weighted and labeled file (Pajek format attached)
- [ ] Load a graph from a file
- [x] Function that checks if the graph is connected
- [x] Function that shows the graph components if it is disconnected (consider weakly connected components for directed graphs)
- [x] Function that checks if the graph is Eulerian or not
- [x] Function that checks if the graph is Cyclic or not
- [x] Function that calculates the Closeness Centrality of each node (consider the shortest-path distance)
- [x] Function that calculates the Betweenness Centrality of each node (consider the shortest-path distance)
- [ ] Random graph generator
	- N nodes
	- N edges
	- Connected or not
- [x] Choose a dataset with:
	- Minimum of 5,000 (five thousand) nodes  
	- Minimum of 20,000 (twenty thousand) edges  
	- The implementation of the previous tasks must support the chosen application  
	- The problem must be modeled by the team, and copies of graphs or code — even partial (including using external graph APIs) — taken from the Internet or other sources will result in a grade of 0 for all involved teams.
